# Homeworks From Other Courses
Repository for homeworks or practices of the courses I took. This repository includes stuff from: 
* Coderbyte Java exams 
* Hackerrank Java, Python, 30 Days of Code (Java), 10 Days of JavaScript
* Kodluyoruz Java101 practices and homeworks

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Most of the major changes normally won't be allowed since it is intended to showing my work about some exercises, practices and homeworks except the ones which could be helpful for another users.
